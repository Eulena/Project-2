          <h2>Correlations Between Obesity vs. Poverty, and Healthcare Risks in America</h2>
          <p>This visualization chart was a result of the data provided to us students, wherein certain associations between 
          demographics and behavioral risk factors from the American Community Survey (ACS), U.S. Census Bureau and 
          the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) during the year 2014 were collected. The chart below proves that the U.S. 
          population are affected by obesity, in that one common findings that exists is that all or virtually all low-income 
          states are far more likely to show signs of obesity. Each marker in this chart represents an individual state in the 
          USA, and as you hover your mouse over by state, the tooltip will display data accordingly by percentage.</p>

          <p>However, in reviewing the entire data, there are some constraints, I believe there are at least two important facts 
          overlooked: (1) the relationship between income and weight can vary by gender, race-ethnicity, or age and, (2) disparities 
          by income varies overtime, particularly for adults.</p>

          <p>Overall, the chart reveals that the state of Arkansas holds the highest percentage of Obesity (35.9%), while the 
          state of New Mexico holds the highest percentage of Poverty (21.3%), the state of West Virginia holds the highest
          percentage of Smoke (26.7%), the state of Texas holds the highest lack of Healthcare (24.9%) in the entire United States
          in the year 2014. This goes to show that there is clearly an an epidemic with such a high impact, in terms of lives and dollars.
          A clear and strong plan for battling the obesity epidemic that impacts tens of millions of lives in the U.S. must be done.</p>

          <p>Data on Obesity standsout in America, and it is a staggering public health crisis, and therefore, it is worth mentioning that one
          of the many obvious culprits we come accross with every day are the super-sized drinks, processed foods and its obscene portion sizes
          widely available in the market.</p>
